## Animation Idea
The idea was to generate an landscape based on the computer game [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/). The biomes map is based on the colorset of the game. The sunrise and sunset were added to relfect the beautiful nature of the game. 

Due to the limitation of time and compute power, ideas such as trees, grass, reflecting water could not be implemented.
